# Age of Empires ECG (2nd edition) ideas
Ideas I had for the [Age of Empires ECG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3127/age-of-empires-expandable-card-game)

## Aims I had
* Finishing it
  * Adding content that was planned but never happened
* Maintaining thematic ties
* Making it affordable
  * Making it non-collectible
    * Making it so players could P&P civilization packs 
* Making it quick to set-up and pack-up
* Making it accessible
  * Releasing the P&P files for free
  * Releasing it on Tabletop Simulator
* Making it pretty
* Making it less of a time commitment to start and finish a game
  * Making it flow better
  * Making it progress faster
    * Reducing how much time players have to stop playing in order to
      * Do calculations
      * Move pieces around
  * Making it take less time to teach
    * Having few rules exceptions
    * Having rules that are intuitive to an extent
* Making it immersive
  * Minimizing how often players have poor options (e.g. useless technologies to choose from)
  * Making it so each game has the potential to be different from the last 
* Making it competitive
  * Making it so no player has an unfair advantage due to access to particular cards that their opponent lacks
  * Making it so no player can utilize dirty tactics (e.g. making it so a player can't play "The King is Dead, Long Live the King" 5 times in a row, which helps them win with a wonder without their opponent being able to attack at all)
  * Making it so there's no entity that can't be stopped, that it has weaknesses 
  * Making it so there's no entity that has no use, that it has strengths
  * Making it so the counter units cost resources too so the defender is set back a bit by responding to the moves of the attacking player
  * Making it so there's some hidden information (if possible) so the attacker has some initiative
  * Making it so each civilization has a shot at winning versus all other civilizations.
* Making it so the winner is the best decision-maker as opposed to the luckiest or best memorizer
  * Making it so luck has little impact on who wins 
* Making it so the game is strategically interesting
  * Making it so players can change their strategy on the fly
  * Making it so there's a range of viable strategies
* Making it so the winner has to utilize skills such as
  * Resource management

## Permissions
**Had approval to come up with this (with non-commercial stipulation) from:**
* The United States Playing Cards Company (USPCC)

**Had approval to re-use art (with non-commercial stipulation) from:**
* Andy De Pooter
* Matt Busch
* Ron Miller
* Joe Corroney
* Jonathan Queen
* Lee Moyer
* David Aikins

## Reasons I stopped working on this
* Had difficulties coming up with solutions for some of the problems I had with the original game
* Had difficulties reaching a Microsoft representative to ensure I wasn't violating their IP rights in making this
* Realized that I underestimated the investment needed to make a board game
  * ~ 250 USD/per card art
  * ~ years of time
* Realized that I don't want to design a board game on one's own since that's a lot harder
  * Partner could help with playtesting
  * Partner could provide input on ideas
  * Partner could provide their own ideas
  * Partner could help with proof-reading the rules
  * Partner could have helpful skills that could be utilized
    * Probability
    * Statistics
    * Graphic design
* Wasn't able to obtain the original Age of Empires ECG assets
* Wasn't certain that there was a large enough audience for this to justify working on it
* Would have preferred to do one's own project from the start with no non-commcerical stipulation so I'd be able to obtain funding
* Worked out that I'd prefer to be involved in making video games over board games
  * Easier to playtest
  * Easier to make changes
  * Have more expertise with this

## Categories it'd fall under
* City Building
* Civilization
* Fighting
* Medieval
* Print & Play
* Video Game Theme

## Mechanics it'd have
* Rock-Paper-Scissors
* Tech Trees/Tech Tracks
* Variable Player Powers


## Ideas I had
### On what I wanted to keep from the AoE ECG
* Need to manage 4 resources
  * Food
  * Gold. Needed more in the mid to late game
  * Stone. Needed more in the mid to late game
  * Wood
* Units having attack bonuses
* Units having a flat attack value
* Units dying
* Units exhausting 
  * Units having an active state
  * Units having an inactive state
* Having a static turn order
* Having smaller-scale battles. Lots of "good trades" are needed. Don't win after winning a single battle with one's army
* Maintaining preexisting unit limits. Should make it easier to calculate the outcome of the battle
* Maintaining a limited base size. Should help make it fit on the table if players can't for example, play a 1 row x 24 columns grid of cards as opposed to a 4 row * 6 columns grid of cards
* Sticking with cards. Affordable. Can fit more information on them. Can present art on them
* Maintaining a tech tree

### On what I wanted to remove from the AoE ECG
* Buildings are what creates land and what explores it
* Blindly drawing cards from a deck
* Pre-game deck-building

### On what I thought wouldn't be best for the AoE ECG
* Cards as resources
* Dice combat
* Abstract battlefield like the patrol zone in Codex

### On what I wasn't sure would be best for the AoE ECG
#### Town board with different action spots concept
* E.g. Town Center having a create villager spot
* E.g. Blacksmith having a research blacksmith technology spot
* E.g. Edge of the board having a fight, raid, and scout spot

### On what I wanted to add to the AoE ECG
#### Heroes concept
* Stats of them are buffed versions of standard units (e.g. Theodoric the Goth is a stronger Huskarl) with the same prerequisites and resource costs as their base model
* Can only be played once
* Can only have one of them
* Can only pick one hero/a game
* Can't convert them
* Can't target them with event cards
* Can attach them to other unit cards
  * Have to kill all other units on the attached unit card before being able to target the hero on it
* Can attach them to other unit cards

#### King of the Hill victory condition concept
* Adding game ending condition if control over a monument is retained for six turns

#### Regicide victory condition concept
* Adding game ending condition if opponent's / your king is killed

#### Score victory condition concept
* Adding game ending condition after a certain number of turns have passed. The player or team with the highest score after whatever amount of turns this is, wins
  * Score based on Age advancement
  * Score based on leftover resources
  * Score based on kills
  * Score based on surviving entities
  * Score based on researced technologies

## Art direction

### Art guidance based on the unit type

* Pagan monks should be as Christian monks but with a goat-head mask.
* Muslim monks should wear an off-white robe and a small circular cap.
* Buhddist monks should be as Muslim monks but with no cap and a bald head.
* Archer units should generally be clad in chain mail or lesser armor. 
* Berserkers and the axe thrower can wear less clothing than the others.
* Janissaries must have their distinctive hats.
* Woad berserkers must have their distinctive tattoos, pants, and neck torques.
