# Age of Empires ECG (2nd edition) ideas
Ideas I had for the [Age of Empires ECG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3127/age-of-empires-expandable-card-game)

## Aims I had
* Finishing it
  * Adding content that was planned but never happened
* Maintaining thematic ties
* Making it affordable
  * Making it non-collectible
    * Making it so players could P&P civilization packs 
* Making it quick to set-up and pack-up
* Making it accessible
  * Releasing the P&P files for free
  * Releasing it on Tabletop Simulator
* Making it pretty
* Making it less of a time commitment to start and finish a game
  * Making it flow better
  * Making it progress faster
    * Reducing how much time players have to stop playing in order to
      * Do calculations
      * Move pieces around
  * Making it take less time to teach
    * Having few rules exceptions
    * Having rules that are intuitive to an extent
* Making it immersive
  * Minimizing how often players have poor options (e.g. useless technologies to choose from)
  * Making it so each game has the potential to be different from the last 
* Making it competitive
  * Making it so no player has an unfair advantage due to access to particular cards that their opponent lacks
  * Making it so no player can utilize dirty tactics (e.g. making it so a player can't play "The King is Dead, Long Live the King" 5 times in a row, which helps them win with a wonder without their opponent being able to attack at all)
  * Making it so there's no entity that can't be stopped, that it has weaknesses 
  * Making it so there's no entity that has no use, that it has strengths
  * Making it so the counter units cost resources too so the defender is set back a bit by responding to the moves of the attacking player
  * Making it so there's some hidden information (if possible) so the attacker has some initiative
  * Making it so each civilization has a shot at winning versus all other civilizations.
* Making it so the winner is the best decision-maker as opposed to the luckiest or best memorizer
  * Making it so luck has little impact on who wins 
* Making it so the game is strategically interesting
  * Making it so players can change their strategy on the fly
  * Making it so there's a range of viable strategies
* Making it so the winner has to utilize skills such as
  * Resource management

## Permissions
**Had approval to come up with this (with non-commercial stipulation) from:**
* The United States Playing Cards Company (USPCC)

**Had approval to re-use art (with non-commercial stipulation) from:**
* Andy De Pooter
* Matt Busch
* Ron Miller
* Joe Corroney
* Jonathan Queen
* Lee Moyer
* David Aikins

## Reasons I stopped working on this
* Had difficulties coming up with solutions for some of the problems I had with the original game
* Had difficulties reaching a Microsoft representative to ensure I wasn't violating their IP rights in making this
* Realized that I underestimated the investment needed to make a board game
  * ~ 250 USD/per card art
  * ~ years of time
* Realized that I don't want to design a board game on one's own since that's a lot harder
  * Partner could help with playtesting
  * Partner could provide input on ideas
  * Partner could provide their own ideas
  * Partner could help with proof-reading the rules
  * Partner could have helpful skills that could be utilized
    * Probability
    * Statistics
    * Graphic design
* Wasn't able to obtain the original Age of Empires ECG assets
* Wasn't certain that there was a large enough audience for this to justify working on it
* Would have preferred to do one's own project from the start with no non-commcerical stipulation so I'd be able to obtain funding
* Worked out that I'd prefer to be involved in making video games over board games
  * Easier to playtest
  * Easier to make changes
  * Have more expertise with this

## Categories it'd fall under
* City Building
* Civilization
* Fighting
* Medieval
* Print & Play
* Video Game Theme

## Mechanics it'd have
* Rock-Paper-Scissors
* Tech Trees/Tech Tracks
* Variable Player Powers


## Ideas I had
### On what I wanted to keep from the AoE ECG
* Need to manage 4 resources
  * Food
  * Gold. Needed more in the mid to late game
  * Stone. Needed more in the mid to late game
  * Wood
* Units having attack bonuses. There's a counter unit for every unit in the game so a large force consisting of all of the same troops shouldn't win if the opponent counters it. 
* Units having a flat attack value
* Units dying
* Units exhausting 
  * Units having an active state
  * Units having an inactive state
* Having a static turn order
* Having smaller-scale battles. Lots of "good trades" are needed. Don't win after winning a single battle with one's army
* Maintaining preexisting unit limits. Should make it easier to calculate the outcome of the battle
* Maintaining a limited base size. Should help make it fit on the table if players can't for example, play a 1 row x 24 columns grid of cards as opposed to a 4 row * 6 columns grid of cards
* Sticking with cards. Affordable. Can fit more information on them. Can present art on them
* Maintaining a tech tree
* Being able to hit and run with ranged units
* Ability to play different playstyles
  * Rushing
  * Booming
  * Turtling

### On what I wanted to remove from the AoE ECG
* Buildings are what creates land and what explores it
* Blindly drawing cards from a deck
* Pre-game deck-building

### On what I observed Age of Empires II had but the ECG did not have
* Ability to garrison troops inside of buildings like towers or castles
  * For protection
  * For healing
  * For dealing more damage inside of the building 
* Chance for animal lures to be unsuccessful
* Defender advantage due to closer production buildings
* Resource depletion. Resources close to you run out first so forced to gain control over other positions of the map that are closer to the enemy for your resources
* Fog of war and large maps, which creates a need for scouting
  * To find where your opponent is
  * To work out what strategy your opponent is going for
  * To work out what armies are coming towards your base and from where
* Need to reseed farms
* Randomly generated maps
* Civilizations faring better on some maps than others
* Inverted pyramid of interesting decisions. The player had to make only a few decisions at first but the number grows
* Race to secure strategically valuable positions on the map
* Sending villagers forward
  * E.g. To make offensive structures like towers
  * E.g. To make military production buildings
  * E.g. To fight with them (in case Sappers is researched)
  * E.g. To repair buildings and siege units
* Well-integrated team-play
  * Need to coordinate with teammates
    * E.g. For trade
    * E.g. For what unit composition to make
    * E.g. For fighting together
    * E.g. For what civilizations to pick

### On what I thought wouldn't be best for the AoE ECG
* Cards as resources
* Dice combat
* Abstract battlefield like the patrol zone in Codex
* Playing cards from binders instead of from a deck
  * Binders are expensive (~ 45 AUD/480 card binder)
  * Binders make it hard to access the cards
* Simultaneous turns or phases of turns

### On what I wasn't sure would be best for the AoE ECG
#### Flipping over the card when the unit is present in a battle
* Way of partially hiding them from the opponent. Can still see where they're moving

#### Drawing units present in a battle from a bag
* Way of fully hiding them from the opponent until the battle happens

#### Town board with different action spots concept
* Could perhaps hide it through a screen until opponent is in your town
* E.g. Town Center having a create villager spot
* E.g. Blacksmith having a research blacksmith technology spot
* E.g. Edge of the board having a fight, raid, and scout spot

### On what I wanted to add to the AoE ECG
#### Card limits concept
* ~ 10 wall cards/per player
* Having a card limit of 1/per player for building and tech cards that are only played up to once/each game (e.g. “Hand Cart”, “Mill”, & “Elite War Elephant (Persian)”)

#### Research phase concept
* Introducing a research phase after the construction phase. In this phase, players can play cards with a research cost 

#### Purchase phase and tactics card concept
* Dividing them into an Age I, II, III, and IV deck based on how powerful they are
* As part of set-up, 3 cards from each of these decks are put in a row and revealed
* During the purchase phase (a new phase that's the first phase of each player's turn), a player can choose to buy up to 3 of these cards if they pay the cost associated with the cards and meet the Age requirements. At the end of a player's turn, new tactics cards are put out to replace taken tactics cards. If a tactics card refers to cards that neither civilization can play (e.g. “Cavalry Archers”) then it may be discarded and replaced with another card. Played tactics cards go in a discard pile


#### Discovery concept
* Exploration of the map results in drawing a discovery card from your discovery cards deck, which consists of: "Boar" x 2, "Sheep" x 4, "Stand of trees" x 3, "Fallen Tree" x 2, "Berries" x 1, "Gold Nugget" x 1, "Exposed Gold Deposit" x 1, "Quarry" x 1,  "Rock Collection" x 1, & unique relic cards x 3. Relics must be placed into No Man's Land upon drawing them. The other cards may be played during the player's current & future turns.

#### In-game deck-building concept
* Browsing through a unit cards deck during the enlistment phase
* Browsing through a building cards deck during the construction phase
* Browsing through a technology cards deck during the research phase
* Setting up each of the decks so that they only consist of cards that a player can play given their civilization and current Age. Throughout the game, more cards will be added to these decks (e.g. upon advancing to the next Age)
* Any of a player's units, buildings, and technologies removed from play return to that player's units, building, and technology deck

#### Heroes concept
* Stats of them are buffed versions of standard units (e.g. Theodoric the Goth is a stronger Huskarl) with the same prerequisites and resource costs as their base model
* Can only be played once
* Can only have one of them
* Can only pick one hero/a game
* Can't convert them
* Can't target them with event cards
* Can attach them to other unit cards
  * Have to kill all other units on the attached unit card before being able to target the hero on it
* Can attach them to other unit cards

#### King of the Hill victory condition concept
* Adding game ending condition if control over a monument is retained for six turns

#### Regicide victory condition concept
* Adding game ending condition if opponent's / your king is killed

#### Score victory condition concept
* Adding game ending condition after a certain number of turns have passed. The player or team with the highest score after whatever amount of turns this is, wins
  * Score based on Age advancement
  * Score based on leftover resources
  * Score based on kills
  * Score based on surviving entities
  * Score based on researced technologies
