# Age of Empires ECG (2nd edition) ideas
Ideas I had for the [Age of Empires ECG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3127/age-of-empires-expandable-card-game)

## Aims I had
* Finishing it
 * Adding content that was planned but never happened
* Having thematic ties
* Making it affordable
* Making it quick to set-up and pack-up
* Making it flow well
 * Reducing how much time players have to stop playing in order to
  * Do calculations
  * Move pieces around  
* Making it accessible
 * Releasing P&P files for free
 * Releasing it on Tabletop Simulator
* Making it easy to teach
 * Having few rules exceptions
 * Having rules that are intuitive to an extent
* Making it pretty
* Making it less of a time commitment to start and finish a game
* Making it immersive
 * Minimizing how often players have poor options (e.g. useless technologies to choose from)
* Making it competitive
 * Making it so no player has an unfair advantage due to access to particular cards that their opponent lacks
 * Making it so no player can utilize unfair tactics (e.g. making it so a player can't play "The King is Dead, Long Live the King" 5 times in a row, which helps them win with a wonder without their opponent being able to attack at all)
 * Making it so there's no entity that can't be stopped, that it has weaknesses 
 * Making it so there's no entity that has no use, that it has strengths
 * Making it so the counter units cost resources too so the defender is set back a bit by responding to the moves of the attacking player
 * Making it so there's some hidden information (if possible)
 * Making it so each civilization has a shot at winning versus all other civilizations.
* Making it so each game has a lot of potential to be different from the last 
* Making it so the winner is the best decision-maker as opposed to the luckiest or best memorizer
 * Making it so luck has little impact on who wins 
* Making it so the game is strategically interesting
 * Making it so players can change their strategy on the fly
 * Making it so there's a range of viable strategies
* Making it so the winner has to utilize skills such as
 * Resource management
