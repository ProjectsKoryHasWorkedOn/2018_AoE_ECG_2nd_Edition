# Age of Empires ECG (2nd edition) ideas
Ideas I had for the [Age of Empires ECG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3127/age-of-empires-expandable-card-game)

## Aims I had
* Finishing it
  * Adding content that was planned but never happened
* Maintaining thematic ties
* Making it affordable
  * Making it non-collectible
    * Making it so players could P&P civilization packs 
* Making it quick to set-up and pack-up
* Making it accessible
  * Releasing the P&P files for free
  * Releasing it on Tabletop Simulator
* Making it pretty
* Making it less of a time commitment to start and finish a game
  * Making it flow better
  * Making it progress faster
    * Reducing how much time players have to stop playing in order to
      * Do calculations
      * Move pieces around
  * Making it take less time to teach
    * Having few rules exceptions
    * Having rules that are intuitive to an extent
* Making it immersive
  * Minimizing how often players have poor options (e.g. useless technologies to choose from)
  * Making it so each game has the potential to be different from the last 
* Making it competitive
  * Making it so no player has an unfair advantage due to access to particular cards that their opponent lacks
  * Making it so no player can utilize dirty tactics (e.g. making it so a player can't play "The King is Dead, Long Live the King" 5 times in a row, which helps them win with a wonder without their opponent being able to attack at all)
  * Making it so there's no entity that can't be stopped, that it has weaknesses 
  * Making it so there's no entity that has no use, that it has strengths
  * Making it so the counter units cost resources too so the defender is set back a bit by responding to the moves of the attacking player
  * Making it so there's some hidden information (if possible) so the attacker has some initiative
  * Making it so each civilization has a shot at winning versus all other civilizations.
* Making it so the winner is the best decision-maker as opposed to the luckiest or best memorizer
  * Making it so luck has little impact on who wins 
* Making it so the game is strategically interesting
  * Making it so players can change their strategy on the fly
  * Making it so there's a range of viable strategies
* Making it so the winner has to utilize skills such as
  * Resource management

**Had approval to re-use art (with non-commercial stipulation) from:**
* Andy De Pooter
* Matt Busch
* Ron Miller
* Joe Corroney
* Jonathan Queen
* Lee Moyer
* David Aikins

## Reasons I stopped working on this
* Had difficulties coming up with solutions for some of the problems I had with the original game
* Had difficulties reaching a Microsoft representative to ensure I wasn't violating their IP rights in making this
* Realized that I underestimated the investment needed to make a board game
  * ~ 250 USD/per card art
  * ~ years of time
* Realized that I don't want to design a board game on one's own since that's a lot harder
  * Partner could help with playtesting
  * Partner could provide input on ideas
  * Partner could provide their own ideas
  * Partner could help with proof-reading the rules
  * Partner could have helpful skills that could be utilized
    * Probability
    * Statistics
    * Graphic design
* Wasn't able to obtain the original Age of Empires ECG assets
* Wasn't certain that there was a large enough audience for this to justify working on it
* Would have preferred to do one's own project from the start with no non-commcerical stipulation so I'd be able to obtain funding
* Worked out that I'd prefer to be involved in making video games over board games
  * Easier to playtest
  * Easier to make changes
  * Have more expertise with this

## Categories it'd fall under
* City Building
* Civilization
* Fighting
* Medieval
* Print & Play
* Video Game Theme

## Mechanics it'd have
* Rock-Paper-Scissors
* Tech Trees/Tech Tracks
* Variable Player Powers


## Ideas I had
### On what I wanted to keep from the AoE ECG
* Need to manage 4 resources
  * Food
  * Gold. Needed more in the mid to late game
  * Stone. Needed more in the mid to late game
  * Wood
* Units having attack bonuses. There's a counter unit for every unit in the game so a large force consisting of all of the same troops shouldn't win if the opponent counters it. 
* Units having a flat attack value
* Units dying
* Units exhausting 
  * Units having an active state
  * Units having an inactive state
* Having a static turn order
* Having smaller-scale battles. Lots of "good trades" are needed. Don't win after winning a single battle with one's army
* Maintaining preexisting unit limits. Should make it easier to calculate the outcome of the battle
* Maintaining a limited base size. Should help make it fit on the table if players can't for example, play a 1 row x 24 columns grid of cards as opposed to a 4 row * 6 columns grid of cards
* Sticking with cards. Affordable. Can fit more information on them. Can present art on them
* Maintaining a tech tree
* Having a researched technologies zone. Can play some technologies on others (E.g. the "Long Swordsman" card on top of the "Man-at-Arms" card) in order to conserve some space
* Being able to hit and run with ranged units
* Ability to play different playstyles
  * Rushing
  * Booming
  * Turtling
* Having combat be as complex as it is now
  * Attack value
  * Attack modifiers value
      * Attack bonuses vs. certain armor classes
      * Attack bonuses due to researched technologies
  * HP value
  * HP modifiers value
      * HP bonuses vs. certain armor classes
      * HP bonuses due to researched technologies
  * Armor classes value
  * Quantity of unit value. This complicates the formula more-so than all the other values
      * Explanation A
<MATH>
Damage = Round down ( (Unit quantity * (Attack factoring in attack modifiers)) / (HP factoring  in HP modifiers) )
</MATH>
      * Explanation B
<MATH>
Damage = The closest positive integer multiple of HP factoring in HP modifiers that can fit into (Unit quantity * (Attack factoring in attack modifiers))
</MATH>

  
### On what I wanted to remove from the AoE ECG
* Buildings are what creates land and what explores it.  A lot of rules had to be introduced in order to make this idea a part of the Age of Empires ECG. It affects how the village is formed (e.g. there's a limit of 3 rows and ∞ columns), how movement works (e.g. a unit can move from a fringe building (a building on the outskirts of one's village sans the bottom edge of one's village) to an opponent's fringe building), and how attacking works (e.g. if your unit card is on an opponent's building card and your opponent has a unit card there too, you have the choice to attack their building or their unit). When I read a sentence like "There are two types of null spaces: non-fringe and fringe", I want to pack-up this game and play another game because understanding how this works is joyless. I don't like it all. This idea was made more complicated with the addition of further rules in the Nautical expansion
* Blindly drawing cards from a deck
* Pre-game deck-building
* Villager research cost.
* Being unable to attack your opponent in the Dark Age

### On what I observed Age of Empires II had but the ECG did not have
* Ability to garrison troops inside of buildings like towers or castles
  * For protection
  * For healing
  * For dealing more damage inside of the building 
* Chance for animal lures to be unsuccessful
* Defender advantage due to closer production buildings
* Town Centers having an attack value
* Castles having an attack value
* Having a line of sight value
* Resource depletion (with the exception of Fish Traps in Age of Empires ECG). Resources close to you run out first so forced to gain control over other positions of the map that are closer to the enemy for your resources
* Fog of war and large maps, which creates a need for scouting
  * To find where your opponent is
  * To work out what strategy your opponent is going for
  * To work out what armies are coming towards your base and from where
* Need to reseed farms
* Randomly generated maps
* Population caps
* Civilizations faring better on some maps than others
* Inverted pyramid of interesting decisions. The player had to make only a few decisions at first but the number grows
* Race to secure strategically valuable positions on the map
* Sending villagers forward
  * E.g. To make offensive structures like towers
  * E.g. To make military production buildings
  * E.g. To fight with them (in case Sappers is researched)
  * E.g. To repair buildings and siege units
* Well-integrated team-play
  * Need to coordinate with teammates
    * E.g. For gifting resources 
    * E.g. For trade
    * E.g. For what unit composition to make
    * E.g. For fighting together
    * E.g. For what civilizations to pick

### On what I thought wouldn't be best for the AoE ECG
* Cards as resources
* Dice combat
* Having action cards
* Keeping track of research technologies via a tech tree. Takes up too much space
* Being awarded VPs for controlling map regions
* Having control groups that represent groups of entities on single spaces of the map
* Having a time limit on turns
* Making the combat much simpler like damage dealt = HP - Attack
* Abstract battlefield like in Ashes Reborn or in Codex (the patrol zone)
* Having an area between players that is fought over like in The Ares Project (the frontier)
* Playing cards from binders instead of from a deck
  * Binders are expensive (~ 45 AUD/480 card binder)
  * Binders make it hard to access the cards
* Simultaneous turns or phases of turns
* Using pen and paper to track resources
* Using a resource track to track resources
* Making combat even more complicated
  * Armor value. This complicates the formula even more
<MATH>
Damage = (Attack of the attacking entity factoring in attack modifiers) - (Armor of the defending entity factoring in armor modifiers) where this can never be  < 0
</MATH>
   * Accuracy value. Having an additional step (seeing if the unit hits or not) would increase the duration of combat. This could, for example, be implemented by having a d10 die roll where you must roll a certain number or higher to hit the target. E.g. For an Archer to hit a unit, this could require a 3 or higher (80% odds of a hit) while for a Trebuchet to hit a unit, this could require a 9 or higher (20% odds of a hit).
   * Rate of fire value


### On what I wasn't sure would be best for the AoE ECG
#### Having resources deplete
* Would resources taken be indicated by taking them off the space?
* Would resources taken be tracked instead of taking them off the space?
* How many resources would you get before having to re-build the Farm/Lumber Camp/Mine/Fish Trap
   * Would technologies like Horse Collar, Heavy Plow, and Crop Rotation increase the amount of food gathered from a farm?
   * Would technologies like Horse Collar, Heavy Plow, and Crop Rotation decrease how quick farms deplete?

 

#### Having map cards indicating how to set-up the map for a variable set-up
* Indicating where particular terrain is
* Indicating resource distirubtion
* Indicating player counts the map supports

#### Having a map with regions that can be contested for
* How big would it be?
* What map features would it represent?
   * Elevation
   * Sea that's passible for naval units
   * Forests
   * Desert
   * Plains
   * Mountains that are impassable
* What resources would map regions contain?
* How would each player's stuff fit on the map?
* How many players could play on the map?
* How would each player's stuff traverse the map?
* Would it be rectangular shaped so cards could fit?
* Would it be diamond shaped?
* Would it be square shaped?
* Would it be hexagonal shaped?
* Would this interface with the Town board of each player? In WarCraft: The Board Game and StarCraft: The Board Game, there's a single tile on the map that interfaces with each player's town.
* Would this introduce an exploration aspect to the game that involves flipping over/placing new map regions

#### Having a movement value on each unit card, which indicfbpates how fast that unit traverses the map

#### Allowing for combat between more than two battle participants

#### Recurring villager cost to unpack/pack the Trebuchet
* This would be opposed to a base villager cost

#### Flipping over the card when the unit is present in a battle
* Way of partially hiding them from the opponent. Can still see where they're moving

#### Drawing units present in a battle from a bag
* Way of fully hiding them from the opponent until the battle happens

#### Town board with different action spots concept
* Could perhaps hide it through a screen until opponent is in your town
* E.g. Town Center having a create villager spot
* E.g. Blacksmith having a research blacksmith technology spot
* E.g. Edge of the board having a fight, raid, and scout spot

### On what I wanted to add to the AoE ECG
#### Time research cost concept
* Using research bits to track technologies that are in the process of being researched. The number of bits on it corresponds to the number of turns it takes for the technology to come into effect. One is removed each turn until the research is complete 

#### Card limits concept
* ~ 10 wall cards/per player
* Having a card limit of 1/per player for building and tech cards that are only played up to once/each game (e.g. “Hand Cart”, “Mill”, & “Elite War Elephant (Persian)”)

#### Research phase concept
* Introducing a research phase after the construction phase. In this phase, players can play cards with a research cost 

#### Purchase phase and tactics card concept
* Dividing them into an Age I, II, III, and IV deck based on how powerful they are
* As part of set-up, 3 cards from each of these decks are put in a row and revealed
* During the purchase phase (a new phase that's the first phase of each player's turn), a player can choose to buy up to 3 of these cards if they pay the cost associated with the cards and meet the Age requirements. At the end of a player's turn, new tactics cards are put out to replace taken tactics cards. If a tactics card refers to cards that neither civilization can play (e.g. “Cavalry Archers”) then it may be discarded and replaced with another card. Played tactics cards go in a discard pile


#### Discovery concept
* Exploration of the map results in drawing a discovery card from your discovery cards deck, which consists of: "Boar" x 2, "Sheep" x 4, "Stand of trees" x 3, "Fallen Tree" x 2, "Berries" x 1, "Gold Nugget" x 1, "Exposed Gold Deposit" x 1, "Quarry" x 1,  "Rock Collection" x 1, & unique relic cards x 3. Relics must be placed into No Man's Land upon drawing them. The other cards may be played during the player's current & future turns.

#### In-game deck-building concept
* Browsing through a unit cards deck during the enlistment phase
* Browsing through a building cards deck during the construction phase
* Browsing through a technology cards deck during the research phase
* Setting up each of the decks so that they only consist of cards that a player can play given their civilization and current Age. Throughout the game, more cards will be added to these decks (e.g. upon advancing to the next Age)
* Any of a player's units, buildings, and technologies removed from play return to that player's units, building, and technology deck

#### Heroes concept
* Stats of them are buffed versions of standard units (e.g. Theodoric the Goth is a stronger Huskarl) with the same prerequisites and resource costs as their base model
* Can only be played once
* Can only have one of them
* Can only pick one hero/a game
* Can't convert them
* Can't target them with event cards
* Can attach them to other unit cards
  * Have to kill all other units on the attached unit card before being able to target the hero on it
* Can attach them to other unit cards

#### King of the Hill victory condition concept
* Adding game ending condition if control over a monument is retained for six turns

#### Regicide victory condition concept
* Adding game ending condition if opponent's / your king is killed

#### Score victory condition concept
* Adding game ending condition after a certain number of turns have passed. The player or team with the highest score after whatever amount of turns this is, wins
  * Score based on Age advancement
  * Score based on leftover resources
  * Score based on kills
  * Score based on surviving entities
  * Score based on researced technologies
